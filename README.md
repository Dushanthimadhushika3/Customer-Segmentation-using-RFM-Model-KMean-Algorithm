# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Model-KMean-Algorithm

Recency, frequency, monetary value is a marketing analysis tool used to identify a company's or an organization's best customers by using certain measures. The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:

Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase
Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase
Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on purchases

In here we have applied RFM model and KMean algorithm to cosmetic dataset which was extracted from an online store.

As the features for KMean algorithm we have used calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.

4 clusters are ientifyied and named as follows.

cluster 0 - Hibernating - low level of all R,F,M
cluster 1 - Recent Customers - high R, middle F and low M
cluster 2 - Potential Loyalist - middle level of all R,F,M
cluster 3 - At Risk Customers - low R, high F,M
